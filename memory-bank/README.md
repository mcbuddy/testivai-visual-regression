# testivAI Visual Regression Memory Bank

This directory contains the memory bank for the testivAI Visual Regression project. It serves as the central knowledge repository for the project, documenting requirements, architecture, technical decisions, and progress.

## Memory Bank Structure

The memory bank consists of the following core files:

1. **projectbrief.md** - Foundation document with core requirements and goals
2. **productContext.md** - Why this project exists and problems it solves
3. **systemPatterns.md** - System architecture and key technical decisions
4. **techContext.md** - Technologies used and development setup
5. **activeContext.md** - Current work focus and next steps
6. **progress.md** - What works, what's left to build, and current status

## Business Documentation

Executive-level business documentation has been moved to the `../bus-doc/` folder:
- **executive-product-roadmap.md** - Strategic 18-month roadmap for executives
- **business-case-executive-summary.md** - Investment case and financial projections

These documents translate the technical context into business value propositions for executive decision-making.
