   - Increased package version from 1.0.15 to 1.0.16 to reflect the fix
   - Updated version reference in CompareCommand.getTestivAIVersion() method
   - This ensures that the template files needed for report generation are properly included in the published package
   - Resolves the "Error during comparison: Template path not found" error that occurred during visual regression testing

   - Added a new set-engine command to the CLI interface that updates the configuration file
   - Enhanced the CompareCommand to read the engine setting from the configuration file
   - Enhanced the CLI output to display the selected comparison engine
   - This enhances the comparison engine options beyond the existing Pixelmatch and Jimp options
   - Prepares the codebase for future integration with OpenCV-based image comparison algorithms

1. **CLI Functionality Improvements** ✅:
   - Fixed issue with InitCommand not actually creating files
   - Added code to write the configuration file to disk
   - Added code to create the necessary directories (.testivai/visual-regression/baseline, compare, reports)
   - Fixed option handling to properly process both kebab-case and camelCase options
   - Updated tests to verify that the InitCommand correctly creates files and directories
   - Increased package version from 1.0.14 to 1.0.15 to reflect the improvements
   - Published the updated package to npm

2. **README Updates** ✅:
   - Added "Quick Start in 5 Minutes" section to README
   - Added a new step for initializing the project with the `testivai init` command
   - Explained what the command does (creates configuration file and directories)
   - Showed how to customize the initialization with options like --diff-threshold
   - Updated the directory paths to match the ones created by the init command
   - Simplified the subsequent steps to leverage the initialization
   - Added command options for more flexibility

3. **Quick Start Documentation** ✅:
   - Added "Quick Start in 5 Minutes" section to README
   - Included clear instructions for installing testivai via npm
   - Added steps for initializing the project with `testivai init`
   - Added steps for capturing baseline screenshots
   - Included commands for running comparison tests

   - Verified all commands in the documentation work correctly

4. **Report Generation and Comparison Bug Fixes** ✅:
   - Fixed issue with report generation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### CLI Functionality Improvements

- **Decision**: Fix the InitCommand to actually create files and directories
- **Rationale**: The InitCommand was only displaying what would be created, but not actually creating the files
- **Implementation**: Added code to write the configuration file to disk and create the necessary directories
- **Implications**: Improved user experience with a working initialization command

### Option Handling

- **Decision**: Update the InitCommand to handle both kebab-case and camelCase options
- **Rationale**: Users might use either format, and both should work correctly
- **Implementation**: Updated the code to check for both formats (e.g., 'diff-threshold' and diffThreshold)
- **Implications**: More flexible and user-friendly CLI commands

### Documentation Strategy

- **Decision**: Add beginner-friendly "Quick Start in 5 Minutes" section to README
- **Rationale**: Make it easier for new users to get started with the tool
- **Implementation**: Added clear steps with shell commands and explanations
- **Implications**: Improved user experience and reduced barrier to entry

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization

- Simple, flat structure with clear separation of concerns
- CLI functionality in commands.ts
- Core interfaces in interfaces.ts
- Utility functions in utils.ts
- Consistent file naming and structure
- Comprehensive test coverage for all modules

### Testing Strategy

- Comprehensive unit tests for all functionality

## Open Questions

1. How can we optimize the report generation for very large test suites?
2. What's the best approach for handling flaky visual tests?
3. How should we integrate with AI services for intelligent diff analysis?
4. What metrics should we track for package usage and performance?
