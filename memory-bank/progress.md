# Progress: testivAI Visual Regression

## Current Status

The testivAI Visual Regression project now features a professional visual regression dashboard with approvals tracking, side-by-side image comparison, and PR metadata integration. The project maintains comprehensive functionality for visual regression testing with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. Recent enhancements include fixing the "Template path not found" error by properly including template files in the published package, adding OpenCV as a new comparison engine option, implementing engine selection logic in the CLI, adding a dedicated set-engine command for changing the comparison engine, and integrating the engine setting with the configuration file.

## Known Issues

### ✅ Report Generation and Comparison Fixed

The report generation and comparison issues have been resolved:

1. **Report Generation Issue**: 
   - **Problem**: Report generation was failing due to incorrect template path
   - **Resolution**: 
     - Updated template path in ReportGenerator constructor to correctly point to templates directory
     - Added tests for the generateReport method in the testivAI class
     - Created test scripts to verify report generation functionality
   - **Benefit**: Reports are now generated correctly

2. **Comparison Issue**:
   - **Problem**: Screenshots were not being found despite existing in the correct directories
   - **Resolution**:
     - Fixed path inconsistency between `.testivAI` and `.testivai` (standardized on lowercase)
     - Fixed template path resolution in the ReportGenerator to handle different installation scenarios
     - Included templates directory in the published package
     - Modified report generation to embed JSON data directly in HTML to avoid CORS issues when viewing locally
     - Improved report layout with checkbox before image name and optimized image grid layout
     - Made report leaner by removing Accept/Reject buttons for unchanged tests
     - Optimized display of images with conditional diff rendering only when needed
     - Added special styling for unchanged tests to make them more compact
     - Added support for CI/CD integration with diffs.json generation for GitHub Actions
     - Published version 1.0.15 of the package with the fixes
   - **Benefit**: Screenshots are now correctly found and compared, generating accurate reports with consistent paths that can be viewed directly from the file system without CORS issues. The report is now more focused on changed tests while still providing access to unchanged tests in a collapsible section, and provides easy integration with CI/CD systems.

### ✅ CLI Functionality Fixed

The CLI functionality issues have been resolved:

1. **InitCommand Issue**:
   - **Problem**: InitCommand was only displaying what would be created, but not actually creating the files
   - **Resolution**:
     - Added code to write the configuration file to disk
     - Added code to create the necessary directories (.testivai/visual-regression/baseline, compare, reports)
     - Fixed option handling to properly process both kebab-case and camelCase options
     - Updated tests to verify that the InitCommand correctly creates files and directories
     - Increased package version to 1.0.15 to reflect the improvements
     - Published the updated package to npm
   - **Benefit**: The InitCommand now properly initializes a project with the necessary files and directories, making it easier for users to get started with the tool.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Initial State**: Single package with mixed concerns

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - **Decision**: Comprehensive test coverage with TDD approach
   - **Rationale**: Ensure reliability and maintainability
   - **Implementation**: 200+ tests across all modules
   - **Outcome**: Robust, well-tested codebase

4. **Documentation Strategy**:
   - **Decision**: Add beginner-friendly "Quick Start in 5 Minutes" section to README
   - **Rationale**: Make it easier for new users to get started with the tool
   - **Implementation**: Four clear steps with shell commands and explanations
   - **Outcome**: Reduced barrier to entry for new users

5. **CLI Functionality**:
   - **Decision**: Fix the InitCommand to actually create files and directories
   - **Rationale**: Improve user experience with a working initialization command
   - **Implementation**: Added code to write the configuration file to disk and create the necessary directories
   - **Outcome**: More user-friendly CLI commands that work as expected
