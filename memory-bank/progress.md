# Progress: testivAI Visual Regression

## Current Status

The testivAI Visual Regression project has successfully evolved from a single package implementation to a comprehensive monorepo architecture with enhanced reporting capabilities. The project now features a professional visual regression dashboard with approvals tracking, side-by-side image comparison, and PR metadata integration.

## Known Issues

The monorepo transformation has resolved several architectural issues while maintaining functionality:

### ✅ Resolved Issues

1. **Package Separation**:
   - **Issue**: Single package contained both SDK and CLI functionality
   - **Resolution**: Clean separation into two focused packages
   - **Benefit**: Users can install only what they need

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - **Issue**: CLI dependencies mixed with SDK dependencies
   - **Resolution**: CLI package depends on SDK package, not vice versa
   - **Benefit**: Cleaner dependency tree and smaller SDK package

3. **Test Organization**:
   - **Issue**: CLI and SDK tests mixed together
   - **Resolution**: Package-specific test suites with appropriate coverage thresholds
   - **Benefit**: Better test isolation and more realistic coverage expectations

4. **Playwright Integration**:
   - **Issue**: No native Playwright support for screenshot capture
   - **Resolution**: Complete Playwright plugin with comprehensive testing
   - **Benefit**: First-class support for Playwright visual regression testing

### 🔄 Ongoing Considerations

1. **Version Synchronization**: Need strategy for coordinating releases between packages
2. **Breaking Changes**: Need process for handling changes that affect both packages
3. **Documentation**: Need to maintain consistency across package documentation
4. **CI/CD**: Need to optimize build and test processes for monorepo structure

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Monorepo Architecture Decision

1. **Initial State**: Single package with mixed concerns
   - **Challenge**: CLI and SDK functionality tightly coupled
   - **Impact**: Users had to install CLI dependencies even for SDK-only usage

2. **Transformation Decision**: Separate into monorepo with focused packages
   - **Rationale**: Better separation of concerns, user choice, independent versioning
   - **Implementation**: npm workspaces with two packages
   - **Outcome**: Clean architecture with maintained functionality

3. **Package Dependency Strategy**:
   - **Decision**: CLI depends on SDK, not vice versa
   - **Rationale**: SDK should be usable independently, CLI is a consumer
   - **Implementation**: CLI package imports from SDK package
   - **Outcome**: Clean dependency hierarchy with no circular dependencies

4. **Testing Strategy Adaptation**:
   - **Decision**: Different coverage thresholds for different package types
   - **Rationale**: CLI tools have different testing challenges than libraries
   - **Implementation**: 94%+ for SDK, 60%+ for CLI
   - **Outcome**: Realistic quality standards for each package type

5. **Documentation Strategy**:
   - **Decision**: Package-specific documentation with monorepo overview
   - **Rationale**: Each package serves different users with different needs
   - **Implementation**: Individual READMEs plus root documentation
   - **Outcome**: Clear guidance for both SDK and CLI users

6. **Playwright Plugin Implementation**:
   - **Decision**: Implement complete Playwright plugin with native API integration
   - **Rationale**: Playwright is a popular testing framework requiring first-class support
   - **Implementation**: Direct integration with Playwright's screenshot API
   - **Outcome**: Robust screenshot capture with comprehensive testing and documentation
