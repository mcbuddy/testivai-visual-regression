## Purpose

These documents translate the technical achievements documented in the memory-bank folder into business value propositions and strategic planning materials suitable for:

- Executive decision-making
- Investment discussions
- Strategic planning sessions

## Relationship to Technical Documentation

The business documents are derived from and complement the technical documentation in the `memory-bank/` folder:
- `memory-bank/` contains detailed technical context and implementation status

Both folders should be kept in sync as the project evolves.
